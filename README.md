# WebSockets-Chat
A basic websocket based chat moved from private TFS server to public.

The project was compiled out of a desire to learn WebSockets outside of XSockets/SignalR.

It's a crude design featuring a console app as the server with a web front end as the client.

The code base was origionally compiled in Nov 2014 - Feb 2015 with minor updates in 2016.
